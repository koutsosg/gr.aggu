If you get sick you can't go to school<br />
Being healthy is really cool</p>
<p>
Always carry your hand cleansing gel<br />
use it often and you will feel well</p>
<p>
Wash your hands before you eat<br />
for at least twenty seconds, don't cheat!</p>

If you get sick you can't go to school<br />
Being healthy is really cool</p>

Cover your nose and mouth when you cough<br />
with a tissue and throw it away</p>
<p>
Share your food but never your fork<br />
avoid a friend who's got a cold</p>
