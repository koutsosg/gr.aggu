<p>
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen<br />
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen<br />
But do you recall<br />
The most famous reindeer of all?</p>
<p>
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br />
Had a very shiny nose<br />
And if you ever saw it<br />
You would even say it glows</p>
<p>
All of the other reindeer<br />
Used to laugh and call him names<br />
They never let poor Rudolph<br />
Join in any reindeer games</p>
<p>
Then one foggy Christmas Eve<br />
Santa came to say<br />
~MaleVoice~<br />
"Rudolph, with your nose so bright<br />
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?"</p>
<p>
Then how the reindeer loved him<br />
As they shouted out with glee<br />
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer<br />
You'll go down in history"<br />
</p>
