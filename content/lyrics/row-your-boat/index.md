<p>
Weather check<br />
boat check<br />
lifejacket check<br />
friends check</p>
<p>
Row, row, row your boat<br />
Gently down the stream<br />
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily<br />
Life is but a dream</p>
<p>
Row, row, row your boat<br />
Row, row, row your boat</p>
<p>
Row, row, row your boat<br />
Gently down the creek<br />
If you see a crocodile<br />
Don't forget to shriek</p>
<p>
Row, row, row your boat<br />
Row, row, row your boat</p>
<p>
Row, row, row your boat<br />
Gently down the river<br />
If you see a polar bear<br />
Don't forget to shiver</p>
<p>
Row, row, row your boat<br />
Gently down to the shore<br />
If you see a lion there<br />
Don't forget to roar<br />
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily</p>
