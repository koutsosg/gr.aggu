<p>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star<br />
how I wonder what you are<br />
Up above the world so high<br />
like a diamond in the sky</p>
<p>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star<br />
How I wonder what you are<br />
Up above the world so high<br />
like a diamond in the sky</p>
<p>
When this blazing sun is gone<br />
when he nothing shines upon<br />
Then you show your little light<br />
twinkle, twinkle, through the night</p>
<p>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star<br />
how I wonder what you are<br />
Up above the world so high<br />
like a diamond in the sky</p>
<p>
In the dark blue sky, you keep<br />
and often through my curtains peep<br />
For you never shut your eye<br />
till the sun is in the sky</p>
<p>
Twinkle, twinkle, little star<br />
how I wonder what you are<br />
Up above the world so high<br />
like a diamond in the sky</p>
