<p>
Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree top<br />
When the wind blows the cradle will rock<br />
If the bough breaks, the cradle will fall<br />
Mother will catch you, cradle and all</p>
<p>

Baby is drowsing, cosy and fair<br />
Mother sits near in her rocking chair<br />
Forward and back, the cradle she swings<br />
Though baby sleeps, he hears what she sings</p>

<p>
Rock-a-bye baby, do not you fear<br />
Never mind, baby, mother is near<br />
Wee little fingers, eyes are shut tight<br />
Now sound asleep until morning light</p>
<p>
Rock-a-bye baby, on the tree top<br />
When the wind blows the cradle will rock<br />
If the bough breaks, the cradle will fall<br />
Mother will catch you, cradle and all</p>
