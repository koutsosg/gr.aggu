<p>
One, Two, Three, Four, Five,<br />
Once I caught a fish alive,<br />
Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten,<br />
Then I threw it back again.<br />
Why did you let it go?<br />
Because it bit my finger so.<br />
Which finger did it bite?<br />
This little finger on my right.
</p>
<p>
One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six,<br /> Seven, Eight, Nine, and finally Ten!<br />
are you ready to sing along with me again?</p>
