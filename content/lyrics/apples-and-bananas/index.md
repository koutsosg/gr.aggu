I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas<br />
With me! I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas<br />

Now change those sounds to an A<br />
I like to ate, ate, ate, ay-ples and ba-nay nays<br />
With me! I like to ate, ate, ate, ay-ples and ba-nay nays</p>
<p>
Now, change those A sounds to an E<br />
I like to eat, eat, eat, ee-ples and bee nee nees<br />
With me! I like to eat, eat, eat, ee-ples and bee nee nees</p>
<p>
Now, change those E sounds to an I<br />
I like to ite, ite, ite, ii-ples and bii nii niies<br />
With me! I like to ite, ite, ite, ii-ples and bii nii niies</p>

Now, change those I sounds to an O<br />
I like to ote, ote, ote, op-ples and bo-no-nos<br />
With me! I like to ite, ite, ite, ii-ples and bii nii niies</p>

With me! I like to eat, eat, eat, apples and bananas.</p>
