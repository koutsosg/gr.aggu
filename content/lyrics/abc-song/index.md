Ducks and donkeys know how<br />
to get the party started now<br />
Hey gorilla dance with me<br />
Aggu has a double g<br />
Here comes a Kangaroo<br />
in his pouch I see Aggu<br />
Penguins dancing to the sound<br />
ice-skating all around</p>

Who is sick? I heard a sneeze<br />
It's a cat that's siamese<br />
Little monkey wants to eat<br />
vegetables under a tree<br />
Happy day in a zoo<br />
animals dance with Aggu<br />
Now I know my ABC's<br />
Next time won't you sing with me</p>
